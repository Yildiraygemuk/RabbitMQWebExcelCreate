# RabbitMQWebExcelCreate
Excel is created in our web application and at the same time download is provided. This process does not provide a good user experience as it takes a long time on large data. We do this by communicating with rabbitMQ via WorkerService. In this way ; Users who install and download excel will have less time to wait for the process to finish.
